Gloss is a popular library for graphics work in Haskell with a
straightforward interface, and quite a few nice examples. As we are
approaching the end of the semester, itâ€™s time for you students to start
spreading your wings and flying on your own, and working with Gloss is
great practice. So, I leave you to the materials above.

> import Graphics.Gloss
> import Data.Monoid
>
> main = display (InWindow "Hello, world!" (200, 200) (200, 200))
>                white
>                (circle 50 <>
>                 (translate (-20) 10    $ circle 10) <>
>                 (translate 20    10    $ circle 10) <>
>                 (translate 0     (-15) $ scale 1 0.7 $ arc 180 360 20))
