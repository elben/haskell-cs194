<ul>
<li><p>Homework assignments are due by midnight ending the day that is listed with the assignment. Assignments will generally be due Fridays.</p></li>
<li><p>Late homework will be accepted with a penalty of 2 points (out of a total of 20) per day (or partial day). For example, homework may be submitted up to midnight on Saturday night for a 2-point penalty, midnight Sunday night for a 4-point penalty, and so on.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="collaborationacademic-honesty">Collaboration/academic honesty</h2>
<p>Collaboration on homework is encouraged. You are also free to consult any outside sources such as tutorials, books, or wikis, and to seek help from sources such as the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IRC_channel">#haskell IRC channel on freenode</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/haskell">StackOverflow</a> (though your first stop for questions should be <a href="http://piazza.com/upenn/fall2014/cis194">piazza</a>).</p>
<p>However, the following restrictions apply:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Homework solutions <strong>must be written individually</strong>. Copying of any portions of code is strictly forbidden.</p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>must cite</strong> any people or resources you consulted in completing an assignment. For example, at the top of an assignment you might write something like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I collaborated with Grace Hopper and Moses Sch√∂nfinkel on this assignment, received help from <code>edwardk</code> in <code>#haskell</code>, and consulted <code>http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Combinatory_logic</code> and <code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14585220/understanding-a-rank-2-type-alias-with-a-class-constraint</code>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>Academic dishonesty of any form will not be tolerated, and will typically result in a score of zero on the assignments in question, at the very least.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Each homework assignment is graded on the following scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>a maximum of 15 points for correctness</li>
<li>a maximum of 5 points for style</li>
</ul>
<p>A revised version of each assignment may be submitted by the due date of the subsequent assignment. The final grade on an assignment is computed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>average</em> of the initial and revised correctness scores, plus</li>
<li>the <em>maximum</em> of the initial and revised style scores.</li>
</ul>
<p>Final grades will computed as a weighted average:</p>
<ul>
<li>70% homework</li>
<li>20% final project</li>
<li>10% participation, including both in-class and online</li>
</ul>
<p>The paritipation grade will also include several quizzes which will take place during class. These quizzes will be graded only for completeness, not correctness, and they will be announced ahead of time. They are an opportunity for you to get a different sort of feedback on your skill level than you can get from homework assignments.</p>
